# **PunchMania: The DIY Punching Madness**

Welcome to the chaos that is **PunchMania**, where instead of swaying your hips to blaring techno, you unleash your inner rage and throw punches at 6 glowing pads. It's like Dance Dance Revolution, but with punches and far less grace. If you're ready to channel your inner boxer while your body wonders what the hell just happened, you're in the right place.

## What is this?

It's a gloriously over-engineered punching machine in a hexagonal grid layout—6 pads, 1 player, infinite adrenaline. Forget everything you thought you knew about rhythm games and get ready for your fists to do the talking.

## Why?

Because why not? Who needs dancing when you can punch? Who needs coordination when you have rage? This is the future of gaming, and it is here to punch you in the face.

## Features (because we should pretend there’s some method to the madness)

- **Hexagonal Pad Layout**: Because regular grids are for the weak.
- **Timing Tracking**: It’s not about how hard you hit—it’s about hitting at the perfect moment. Are you fast enough? Are you on beat? Will you hit in time? Only one way to find out.
- **LED Glory**: Watch the pads light up as you beat the hell out of them. Your fists deserve a stage.
- **DIY**: This is not your grandma’s game—this is built by the unhinged, for the unhinged. You’ll need some wiring, sensors, and probably a fair amount of therapy.

## How To Play

1. Stand in front of the machine. 
2. Don’t think too hard.
3. Punch the hexagonal pads as they light up. 
4. Repeat until you’re dizzy, out of breath, or simply too proud of yourself.
5. Check your score (if you care about that sort of thing).

## Getting Started

(I do need to upload the files, just so you know)
1. Download the code (or steal it, I don't care).
2. Solder the sensors, wires, and dream of a better world.
3. Assemble the pads in a hexagonal layout. If it doesn't work, just punch it until it does.
4. Pray it works. It usually does, but no guarantees.
5. Test it. Punch it. Have fun.
